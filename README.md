# Prediction of potential inhibitors for the Sars-CoV-2 Helicase (Nsp13) by virtual screening and MD simulations

This folder serves a workflow for docking-based virtual screening followed up with the MD simulations.

## Background
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has caused widespread illness and death worldwide. One of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins responsible for viral replication is the non-structural protein 13 (NSP13). NSP13 is a helicase from the 1B superfamily and plays a crucial role in viral replication and pathogenesis. Due to its high sequence conservation NSP13 is an attractive target for drug development. In this work, virtual screening of the European Chemical Biology Database (ECBD) was employed to predict potential NSP13 inhibitors. Molecular dynamics simulations provided in-depth analysis of molecular interactions between NSP13 and the proposed inhibitors. Results of this study may act as a starting point for anti-viral drug development targeting NSP13.
